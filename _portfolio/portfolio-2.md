## Problem Statement
Studentâ€™s attendances are taken manually using attendance sheets which is a time consuming event. Moreover, in a large classroom it is difficult to find out if the claimed student is actually present or not. Since it is difficult to overcome the above two mentioned problems by manual labour this project depicts an automated attendance system using face recognition to tackle the same.
