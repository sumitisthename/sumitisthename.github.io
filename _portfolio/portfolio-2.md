## Problem Solved

This project tackles the complexity of financial analysis by creating a team of specialized AI agents that work together to provide a comprehensive investment recommendation. This approach allows for a more thorough and data-driven analysis than a single agent could provide.

## Technologies Used

* LangGraph
* Streamlit
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* yfinance
* Groq API
* CodeCarbon

This project is a multi-agent financial system that uses LangGraph to analyze market data, forecast asset prices, identify risks, ensure compliance, and make investment decisions. The system is designed to be a proof-of-concept for applying autonomous agents to complex financial tasks.
