## üéØ Project Overview

**Aeroinsights** is an intelligent analytics platform that transforms unstructured airport review data into actionable business insights. The system uses advanced NLP techniques and generative AI to help airport authorities understand customer sentiment, identify improvement areas, and make data-driven decisions.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

| **Component** | **Technology** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | Interactive web application |
| **Web Scraping** | Selenium & BeautifulSoup | Data collection from Skytrax |
| **Text Processing** | LangChain | Document splitting and chunking |
| **Embeddings** | OpenAI Embeddings | Text vectorization |
| **Vector Database** | FAISS | Similarity search engine |
| **LLM** | OpenAI GPT | Response generation |
| **Development** | PyCharm | Python IDE |

## üîÑ System Flow

### 1. User Selection
The application prompts users to select an airport for review analysis from a curated list of major international airports.

### 2. Data Collection
Automated web scraping extracts all reviews for the selected airport from Skytrax using Selenium WebDriver.

### 3. Text Processing
- **Chunking**: Reviews are split into manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
- **Overlapping**: Controlled overlap maintains context continuity
- **Embedding**: Chunks are converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI

### 4. Intelligent Retrieval
- **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are indexed in FAISS for fast similarity search
- **Semantic Search**: User queries are matched with relevant chunks based on semantic similarity

### 5. Response Generation
- **Context Assembly**: Relevant chunks are combined with user query
- **LLM Processing**: OpenAI GPT generates comprehensive responses
- **Source Attribution**: Responses include source references for transparency
