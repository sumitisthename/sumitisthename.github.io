## 🔄 System Flow

1. **Airport Selection**  
   Users choose an airport for review analysis from a curated list.

2. **Data Collection**  
   Web scraping extracts reviews from Skytrax via Selenium.

3. **Text Processing**  
   - Splitting with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`  
   - Controlled overlap for context preservation  
   - Vector embeddings using OpenAI API  

4. **Intelligent Retrieval**  
   - Embeddings stored in FAISS  
   - Semantic similarity search with user query  

5. **Response Generation**  
   - Contextual assembly of relevant chunks  
   - GPT-based response generation  
   - Source attribution for transparency
