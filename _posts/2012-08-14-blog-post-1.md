# Discovering Kedarkantha

Welcome to my travel blog! Today, I am excited to share my incredible journey to [Kedarkantha], a place filled with stunning landscapes, rich culture, and unforgettable experiences. Join me as I explore the highlights of this amazing destination.

# Kedarkantha

## Day 1: Bangalore to Delhi
We were a group of 7 trekkers who boarded the flight from Bangalore to Delhi on mission to conquer the summit of kedarkantha. We reached Delhi late evening from where we took a cab to hazrat nizamuddin railway station. A little past midnight we boarded the train to Dehradun from here.

## Day 2: Dehradun to Sankri Village
The base camp for the trek at Sankri was about 8-10 hours from Dehradun. Upon arrival at Dehradun we boarded an early morning bus to Sankri. The bus ride was majestic as one can get the view of everflowing Yamuna river from a close lens. The first glimpse of the majestic Himalayas can be seen during this journey too. Upon arrival at sankri base camp late in the afternoon we explored the village and interacted with the locals. A long bus journey and the biting cold weather called for a nice warm dinner. Local lentil soup, warm rotis and salad were served to end the day, but not before our trek leader briefed us for the all-important days ahead

## Day 3: Sankri Village to Juda ki Talab
**Difficulty: Medium-Hard**
The day we all waited for the last 4 months had finally arrived. Waking up to the chilly winds, amidst the mountains in the backdrop and sense of excitement was an emotion hard to depict through words. First day of the trek from sankri to juda ki talab was 5kms. My thoughts on this is do not go by the numbers and just enjoy the journey. Day 1 of the trek might seem difficult to many as it takes a while to get used to the terrain. But believe it or not, once you hit the canopy of coniferous trees, every step you take becomes a cherished moment, as the view only gets better.
There is one thing you will find out on this day is the secret ingredient to maggi was always the hills. The tea and maggi at pit stops along the way is absolutely scrumptious. Our first camp site was juda ki talab. Reaching there by afternoon gave us enough time for us to play in the snow. All is well till the sun dips as temperature drops to -10C.

## Day 4: Juda Ki Talab to Kedarkantha Base Camp.
**Difficulty: Easy - Medium**
This was one of the more relaxed days. After a revitalizing breakfast, we set off on our journey to the Kedarkantha Base Camp, our next destination. The trek to base camp is 4Kms .One the way you would see the frozen Juda Ki Talab. Typically this the first break for the day. One can chill, take pictures and relax amidst the view of the frozen lake. “Why do we fall, so we can pick ourselves up” the famous quote from Dark Knight is something worth remembering. The route is quite slippery so get ready to slip and perhaps even fall a couple of times. The camp cook welcomed us on the base camp with some hot and fresh rajma. Our trek guide pointed at the summit and showed us what we needed conquer early next morning.  cd .. we reached the campsite quite early we were advised not to sleep and keep ourselves active.
