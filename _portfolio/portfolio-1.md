# System Flow

### Step 1 – User Selection
The application prompts the user to select an airport for review analysis.

### Step 2 – Web Scraping
The application scrapes all reviews for the selected airport from the Skytrax website using Selenium.

| Retrieval QA with Source Chain          | Retrieve Relevant Information Chunk                  |
| OpenAI LLM                              | Large Language Model                                 |

# Solution Details

The libraries used are:
1. `streamlit` (imported as `st`)
2. `pickle`
3. `time`
4. `langchain` (specifically, `OpenAI` and various components from `langchain.chains`, `langchain.text_splitter`, `langchain.document_loaders`, `langchain.embeddings`, and `langchain.vectorstores`)

### Step 3 – Splitting the Data
The scraped data is divided into multiple chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. This segmentation helps filter only the relevant chunks for the LLM model in the subsequent step, thereby reducing the number of tokens sent to the OpenAI LLM and saving costs.

### Step 4 – Overlapping Chunks
This step involves overlapping the chunks in controlled amounts to maintain the context continuity of each chunk, ensuring the integrity of the splits' meanings. This prevents meaningless splits that could lead to unreasonable answers.

### Step 5 – Embedding Creation
The overlapped chunks are then converted into embedding vectors using OpenAI embeddings. This facilitates semantic searches within the database.

### Step 6 – Storing Vectors and Semantic Search
The embeddings are then stored as indices in FAISS, where a semantic search is performed based on the similarity index between the chunks and the user-provided query.

### Step 7 – Text Analysis and Response Generation
The chosen data segments and user query are forwarded to the OpenAI LLM, accompanied by a standard prompt, for data examination and response formulation.

### Step 8 – LLM Response Display
The response generated by the LLM is displayed on the web application.

# Expected Outcome

The aim of the application is to provide a user-friendly interface for analyzing airport reviews. After a user selects an airport, the application comprehensively reads all associated reviews. It then stands ready to address any questions regarding these reviews.

Users can, for instance, prompt the application to identify the most frequently mentioned feature of a chosen airport. Inquiries can range from discerning the best and worst facilities to gauging the overall public sentiment surrounding the airport. The depth and focus of the application's insights are directed by the specificity of the user's prompts, as seen in the provided user interface.

## Relevance to Business Analytics

The Airport Analyzer application holds immense promise in the realm of business analytics, offering invaluable insights into customer experience, operational efficiency, competitive analysis, and strategic decision-making. Its global reach further amplifies its significance, providing a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and enabling the customization of services to meet diverse customer needs.

1. Data-driven Decision Making

The project uses NLP approaches to extract significant insights from unstructured data (such as airport reviews). These insights enable airport administrators to make data-driven decisions about infrastructure upgrades, service improvements, and resource allocation.

2. Operational Efficiency

Insights from customers can provide valuable feedback on various operational aspects, such as check-in processes, security procedures, and overall airport facilities. Business analysts can use this insight to improve the overall passenger experience.

3. Predictive Analytics

By analysing historical airport evaluations, the AI system may discover trends and patterns, allowing for predictive analytics. This enables preventive steps to resolve potential issues before they escalate, resulting in higher overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

4. Customer Experience Optimization

The application's ability to discern sentiments and preferences from user reviews allows airports to successfully modify their services and facilities to match consumer expectations. This promotes improved customer experiences, resulting in increased consumer satisfaction and loyalty.

5. Strategic Decision Making

Insights from AI can help airport authorities, airlines, and stakeholders make strategic decisions in the aviation business. Business analysts can help airports and airlines develop data-driven plans, optimize resource allocation, and increase their worldwide competitiveness.
